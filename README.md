# Getting and Cleaning Data, Tidy Data Peer Assessment Project

This repo includes:

1. Raw data in the ["UCI HAR Dataset" folder](/UCI%20HAR%20Dataset)
2. A script named [`run_analysis.R`](run_analysis.R) designed to read the data in, merge it, select a subset, and output a small tidy dataset of means of selected columns.
3. A [`CodeBook.md` file](CodeBook.md) file that details the step-by-step analysis and describes the final variables retained in the dataset.
